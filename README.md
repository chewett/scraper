Scraper
=======

A simple python module designed for downloading and scraping data from the internet.

This has slowly grown out of various projects interacting with a wide range of API's and websites over the many years.
You probably actually want to use something more expressive like beautifulsoup or something but this is more basic
for my own quick scripts.
